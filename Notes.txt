const express = require("express");

const app = express(); //instance of express js application

//the below function is known as the request handler for "/"
app.use("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello from the dashboard")
})

//the below function is known as the request handler for "/test"
app.use("/test",(req,res)=>{
    console.log("test")
    res.send("test from the server")
})

//the below function is known as the request handler for "/hello"
app.use("/hello",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello hello")
})

app.listen(7777, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 7777");
});

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

episode 4
Writing order of routes matter alot

Open POSTMAN
Create a Workspace
Create a Collection(Collection is like a collection of api's)

42min - app.use() matches all the HTTP methods API calls. With app.use it handles all types of http methods
app.get("/user",(req,res)=>{
    
})  this will only handle GET call to /user

CODE:
    const express = require("express");

    const app = express(); //instance of express js application

    //the below function is known as the request handler for "/user"
    app.get("/user", (req, res) => {
        res.send({
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
        });
    });

    app.post("/user", (req, res) => {
        res.send("User created");
    });

    app.delete("/user", (req, res) => {
        res.send("User deleted");
    });

    app.listen(7777, () => {
        console.log("Server is running on port 7777");
    });

51min
Advanced routing
/ab+c, /ab?c,/ab*cd

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Episode 5

One route can have multiple route handlers like shown below

    app.use(
    "/user",
    (req, res) => {
        //route handler 1
        res.send("response 1");
    },
    (req, res) => {
        //route handler 2
        res.send("response 2");
    }
    );

    Use next() when you want to call the second route handler
    app.use(
    "/user",
    (req, res, next) => {
        //route handler 1

        next();
        res.send("response 1");
    },
    (req, res) => {
        //route handler 2

        res.send("response 2");
    }
    );

42 min - Middlewares
Whenever you make an api call, it basically goes through a middleware chain and finally goes to the request handler which send us the response

Difference between app.use() and app.all()

Order of arguments: 1st is the error,2nd is the request,3rd is the response,4th is the next
app.use("/admin",(err,req,res,next)=>{
    if(err){
        res.status(500).send("Something went wrong")
    }
})

---------------------------------------

Season 2 episode 6
To connect to the Database we will be using Mongoose

In the cluster there can be multiple Databases
Collection(Table)

Once you have established a successfull connection to your Database then you should listen to the port

What is a Schema in a Database???
Schema is a blueprint of a collection, What all things are required to create a user.
Creating a User schema means what all things a user will have. example: name, id,email, password etc

We will create schema using mongoose

In the models - We define what all fields the user collection will have

Once you have created a Schema , we create a mongoose model, by writing mongoose.model(name of the model,schema)

Whenever you are saving/getting a data on database, all the methods returns you a promise

Database then Collection then Document.There can be multiple documents inside a Collection

app.js

    const express = require("express");
    const { connectDB } = require("./config/database");
    const User = require("./models/user");

    const app = express(); //instance of express js application

    app.post("/signup",async (req, res) => {
    const user = new User({
        firstName: "Katrina",
        lastName: "kaif",
        emailId: "katrina@yopmail.com",
        password: "123456",
    }); //creating a new instance of User model

    try {
        await user.save();  // this will save dummy data in database
        res.send("User created");
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send("Error creating user");
    }

    });

    connectDB()
    .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to the database");

    //listen to the port after successfull connection to the database
    app.listen(7777, () => {
      console.log("Server is running on port 7777");
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log("Failed to connect to the database"));

  _id and __v are automatically added by mongodb when we create a new document


-------------------------------------------------

Season 2 episode 7
express json middleware - converts json object to javascript object

these all methods are available on the mongoose model, check documentation 
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html
Model.find() - returns all the documents from the collection
Model.findOne() - returns the first document from the collection
Model.findById() - returns the document with the given id

1hr 6min - patch and put

1hr 16min - If it is not present in the schema it will not be added in the Database. Any other data which is apart from schema will be ignored by the API's

--------------------------------------------------

Season 2 episode 8
Adding validation in schema such as required , unique , default , lowercase etc

23min - how to create a custom validation function, just write a function called as validate.
The validate function works perfect when you are inserting a new document but not when you are updating a document

35 min - Adding timestamps 
Pass {timestamps:true} while cretaing the schema

47 min - API level validations

59 min 30 sec - Using id in url for updating users data and accessing the userId using params

1hr 9 min - Applying validation using the npm package validator

--------------------------------------------------

Season 2 episode 9

What's the purpose of writing code in try catch block, if anything fails in the try block the catch block will catch the error

Whenever a user signs up, the first thing we should do is validation of data, after validating we should encrypt the password and then save it in database

15min - To encrypt password we will use a package bcrypt

--------------------------------------------------

Season 2 Episode 10

You cannot access some pages without loggin in 
When you make a login request after verifying the email and password the server sends back a authentication token(JWT)
This JWT is wrapped inside Cookie and the Cookie is sent to the user(client), you can also set an expiry to the cookie

24 min - To read the cookie we need a cookie parser

32 min - JWT token has 3 parts - One is header, payload and signature
We use a package to generate the jwt
We use .sign method to generate the token

Token is expired/invalid means we need to login again so that the token gets generated

1hr 22 min - How to set expiry time on your JWT

1hr 28 min - Expiring a cookie

1hr 37 min - Mongoose Schema Methods

---------------------------------------------------

Season 2 Episode 11

21 min
Handling routing using proper way i.e by using Express Router


example:
authRouter, will handle auth related requests
-POST /signup
-POST /login
-POST /logout

profileRouter, will handle profile related requests
-GET /profile/view
-PATCH /profile/edit

userRouter, will handle user related requests
-GET /user/connections
-GET /user/requests

----------------------------------------------------

Season 2 Episode 12

45 min : Writing query in mongoDB
1hr 3 min : Creating Schema Validations
1hr 17 min : How to put an Index in your DB
Suppose there are 1000 people using your app, and these 1000people are sending connection request to each other,your collection will grow and queries will become expensive(slow)
When you index your DB your API becomes faster
In your auth,js file, you are finding the user by email, so you should put an index on email field
In MongoDB if you are making a field as unique, MongoDB will automatically create a index for that

For Compound Index: 1 means ascending order and -1 means descending order

-------------------------------------------------------

Season 2 Episode 13

Writing API for accepting and rejecting a connection request
